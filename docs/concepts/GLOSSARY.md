| **Keyframe**           | A complete frame that does not depend on other frames (I-frame).                                             |
| **Luma**               | Brightness component in YCbCr color representation.                                                          |
| **MDCV**               | Mastering Display Color Volume. HDR10 metadata describing the display's color primaries and luminance range.  |
| **CLLI**               | Content Light Level Info. HDR10 metadata specifying maximum content and frame-average light levels.            |
| **PCM**                | Pulse-Code Modulation. Uncompressed audio format.                                                            |
| **PQ**                 | Perceptual Quantizer (SMPTE ST 2084). An HDR transfer function with absolute brightness encoding up to 10,000 nits. Used by HDR10. |
| **Pixel format**       | How color data is laid out in memory for each pixel (e.g. BGRA 8-bit, YCbCr 10-bit).                         |
| **ProRes**             | Apple's family of intraframe, visually lossless video codecs.                                                |
| **Resolution**         | Pixel dimensions of a video frame (width x height).                                                          |
